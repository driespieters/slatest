# Slatest

ðŸ›’ Shopify theme development toolkit

## Why?

Well, [Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/) is Shopify's toolkit but [absurdly discontinued](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/issues/1020), and [Slater](https://github.com/the-couch/slater) is a proposed alternative - but not nearly as stable as is made out. For example, it [doesn't work on Windows](https://github.com/the-couch/slater/issues/11) and I've [made efforts](https://github.com/the-couch/slater/pull/63) to repair it but it might be a lost cause and the monorepo structure is an absolute nightmare to work with, in my opinion, such as how you could never npm install a fork to test it.

Aaaanyways.. TL;DR we need various simple features for a productive workflow:

- Browser reloading (HMR style for CSS changes)
- SCSS compilation
- ES6 JS compilation
- Template and asset sync with Shopify

## Usage

    npm i slatest

Create a `slatest.config.json` file in your project root along the lines of:

```json
{
  "themeId": "11111111111",
  "appPassword": "66666666666666666666666666666666",
  "store": "my-store-name.myshopify.com",
  "watch": ["**/*.liquid", "assets/**"],
  "ignore": ["assets-backup", "node_modules"]
}
```

You will need to create a new theme in the Shopify admin, and get it's ID from the URL for your themeId value. Also, create a new private app with 'Theme templates and theme assets' permissions set to `Read and write` then use its password as your appPassword value.

Add yourself some `package.json` scripts such as:

```json
    "start": "slatest"
    "delete-entire-theme": "slatest --wipe"
```

And fire it up!
